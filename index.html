                <h2>1. What Went Right</h2>
                    <p>
                        The development process of our <strong>Reciply</strong> app was a collaborative effort that resulted in several successful 
                        outcomes. Through thorough planning and careful implementation of key features, we were able to deliver a 
                        functional and scalable application.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Application Structure and Planning</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    
                            One of the things that contributed to our success was our application structure and careful planning. 
                            From the beginning, we chose to use the <strong>3-layer architecture</strong> consisting of the presentation, business, 
                            and persistence layers. This approach enabled us to split the tasks evenly within our group and take 
                            responsibility for each of the layers assigned to them which effectively maintains a clear codebase and
                            a clear understanding of each of our responsibilities. Furthermore, carefully breaking down features 
                            into smaller ones such as user stories, and breaking it down further into developer tasks, has significantly 
                            impacted our task management in a more efficient and positive way. This led to a comprehensive understanding 
                            of individual tasks to be given out that does not lead to developer task conflicts as this is one of the main 
                            problems that arise during a professional software development cycle. Each of the developers knows which layer 
                            they’re working on and knows what tasks to do, which leads to a smooth development process without any code conflicts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Additionally, one of the crucial aspects of our development process was our commitment to deliver working and testable 
                            features. Early on in our development process, we utilized <strong>JUnit</strong> for unit testing to make sure that individual classes, 
                            and even the methods, work perfectly and seamlessly without its dependencies and to verify their correctness. This led 
                            to us catching bugs and fatal errors before it gets implemented into our main branch. Furthermore, as our project continues 
                            forward and scaled considerably, we began to utilize integration testing to further test each of the classes and methods 
                            and verify its correctness between the seams of layers, especially the logic-to-persistence layer. This improved our confidence 
                            that methods that are used are working seamlessly across each of the layers. Finally, we used <strong>Espresso</strong> to test our presentation 
                            layer and do system/acceptance tests to verify that a feature is working as intended.Debugging was also used for the things that 
                            we could not really anticipate in testing which allowed us to monitor and comprehensively track where things go wrong. Through 
                            these tests, we have resolved major issues before they even get finalized, ensuring the application’s reliability and minimizing 
                            unexpected fatal errors and issues.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h4>Scalable Database Implementation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Lastly, another contributor to the success of our application is the scalable implementation of our persistence layer. Ensuring 
                            that this layer remains scalable is one of the most crucial aspects of our application as it grows and begins to implement more 
                            features. Initially, we began to implement our persistence layer which uses only stubs, however, knowing that we would scale into 
                            a working database, we carefully ensured that it will be easy to implement the <strong>HSQLDB</strong> implementation and in the future, if we use 
                            another database, it is easily implemented through the use of interfaces. DSO (Domain-specific objects) models were also thoroughly 
                            implemented to be scalable. This ensures that if we begin to add more attributes to an object, such as a recipe’s image, date added, 
                            etc., they would be easily implemented through the use of an <strong>appropriate design pattern</strong>, such as what we did with our Recipe object 
                            using a <strong>Builder design pattern</strong> . This allows for flexibility in the future without greatly refactoring our application as not only it 
                            provided clear data management, but also made it easier to extend functionality.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In conclusion, our structured approach to development, careful testing and debugging, and a scalable and maintainable persistence 
                            layer were some of the notable aspects that contributed to our Reciply app’s success. By doing these approaches, we created a functional, 
                            stable, and scalable application which provides a strong foundation for future enhancements and expansion.

                <h2>2. Design Smells and Brilliant Decisions</h2>

                    <p>
                        Throughout our development of this application, we have utilized some strong design choices that enhanced the maintainability and 
                        extensibility of our application. However there also some code smells that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the development 
                        process in the future as this develops further. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Brilliant Design Decisions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <p>One of the most important and clever aspects of our development process was the use of design patterns, which improves scalability, 
                            flexibility, and maintainability. Here are some of the notable design patterns that were used throughout our development process:
                        </p>
                                        
                        <h4>Effective use of design patterns</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Adapter Pattern (UI Components):</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    These are used to handle dynamic UI elements such as the RecyclerView from our main recipes homepage.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Builder Pattern (for Recipe DSO Model):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Since this is one of the most important objects in our application, this would be subjected to constant 
                                    changes and additionally key features that would be implemented
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    This design pattern effectively allows for easily adding/deleting attributes for the recipe object without 
                                    the extensive use of constructor overloading.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Singleton Pattern (Persistence Objects Instances):</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    To manage database interactions more efficiently
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    This prevents unnecessary multiple database connections and ensures consistent data access across all 
                                    layers of the application.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Code Smells (To be improved in the future)</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lack of Code Documentation:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps one noticeable issue in our codebase is that some of the classes, and even methods, lack necessary 
                            comments and documentation. This may raise concerns in the future as it would be difficult to read and follow 
                            the codebase if perhaps another team would eventually handle this project. There were some instances where:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Complex methods, such as in the business layer, lack necessary step-through comments to ensure that other 
                                developers reading may follow along the logic.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Responsibilities of classes are not documented properly, which would lead to unnecessary code being added 
                                in the future that may violate the Single-responsibility principle, and other SOLID principles.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hardcoded Strings:</strong> 
                        <p>
                            Another design issue was the excessive use of hardcoded strings, especially in the presentation and business layer. 
                            Instead of using string resources that are particularly designed for these, such as the <strong>strings.xml</strong>, some parts contains:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                UI texts are hardcoded, making it difficult to be maintained and internationalized.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Some error messages are hardcoded, instead of making them constant in a file (e.g. strings.xml)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Presence of Unused Code:</strong> 
                        <p>
                            While this perhaps may help in the future such that developers may not need to implement anymore, saving time, this 
                            could lead to several issues such as creating confusion among future developers. Regularly refactoring and removing
                            dead code ensures that the code is clean and easily maintained, using only necessary code that would be used.
                        </p>
