            <h2>Reciply - Recipe Collection Vision Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The Reciply app is a user-friendly mobile recipe management tool that provides centralized
                recipe storage, meal planning tools, cooking instructions and sharing capabilities to
                simplify and enhance the cooking experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app will be used by home cooks, culinary enthusiasts, families, fitness enthusiasts,
                and individuals learning to cook who need a simple and effective way to organize, access,
                and share recipes. Unlike traditional handwritten recipe books or scattered digital files,
                Reciply will offer an intuitive, all-in-one platform with exciting features such as the
                ability to create recipes, shopping list generation, and tools to support dietary goals and

            </p>
            <p>
                For Reciply to succeed, it must achieve three key milestones. First, the app should reach
                at least 7,000 downloads within the first three months, showing strong interest and
                adoption from users. Second, it should maintain an average rating of 3.5 or higher,
                reflecting user satisfaction and trust in its features. Lastly, at least 40% of users should
                actively engage with the app weekly, proving its value as a dependable and enjoyable
                cooking companion. These goals will help ensure Reciply becomes a cherished tool for home
                cooks, families, and food lovers everywhere.

            <!-- POSTMORTEM & RETROSPECTIVE SECTION -->
            <section id="postmortem">
            <h2>Postmortem & Retrospective</h2>
            <p>Below is a reflection on our development process, addressing key questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <strong>Overall Architecture:</strong> We adopted a layered architecture separating the
                front-end (using a modern UI framework) from the back-end (using RESTful APIs and a
                database). This approach allowed each layer to be developed and tested independently.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>What Went Right:</strong> Agile practices (daily stand-ups, scrums, pair
                programming) enabled quick identification of issues and faster iteration. Frequent
                communication helped us meet deadlines and stay on track with our user stories.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>What Went Wrong:</strong> Early on, merging conflicts and inconsistent coding
                styles caused delays. We resolved this by implementing a strict branching strategy and
                style guidelines, but it cost us valuable time.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>What We Would Do Differently:</strong> We would invest more time in design and
                prototyping before coding. Setting up robust continuous integration testing earlier would
                also reduce bugs slipping through the cracks.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Project Size & Quantifiables:</strong> The project includes about 50 methods and
                18 classes in total. Around 40% are devoted to UI and front-end functionality, 40% to
                back-end logic and data handling, and 20% to testing and utility classes. Each team
                member contributed approximately 15–20 hours per week.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Time Spent & Surprises:</strong> UI polishing took the most time due to frequent
                user feedback and design tweaks. Implementing the recipe search feature was surprisingly
                quick once the back-end was structured properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Design Smells or Brilliant Decisions:</strong> Our decision to keep data models
                lightweight and flexible turned out great for quickly iterating on new features. However,
                we occasionally found ourselves duplicating validation logic between front-end and
                back-end, which we consider a minor design smell.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Outstanding Bugs:</strong> We have a rare edge case where certain special
                characters in recipe names cause display issues. We’re planning a patch to address it in
                a future release.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Features That Exceeded Expectations:</strong> The user-generated shopping list
                feature quickly became a favorite, garnering positive feedback for its ease of use and
                time-saving capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Extra Technologies Used:</strong> We integrated a cloud-based testing service for
                device simulation, which wasn't strictly required but helped expedite QA on multiple
                platforms.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Specific Techniques:</strong> We practiced TDD for core functionalities,
                conducted pair programming for complex features, and held scrums twice a week to maintain
                alignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Project Changes from Iteration 0:</strong> Our initial vision was mostly
                maintained, though we added user profile features based on feedback and shifted some
                priorities (e.g., the shopping list tool rose to higher importance).
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Lessons Learned About Team Development:</strong> We learned that transparent
                communication and frequent code reviews are crucial. Next time, we'll start with stronger
                style guidelines, keep daily stand-ups short but frequent, and maintain an updated
                product backlog to avoid scope creep.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Building Reciply confirmed the importance of an iterative
                approach, robust testing, and strong teamwork. Focusing on the user experience from the
                start proved vital for delivering a product that genuinely simplifies cooking and recipe
                management.
